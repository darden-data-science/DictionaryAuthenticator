# DictionaryAuthenticator

This is an authenticator that checks passwords against a plain text dictionary of passwords. This is taken almost verbatim from the Jupyterhub docs [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/authenticators.html#authenticator-authenticate-method). This is just packaging it in a pip installable package.
